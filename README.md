IFCS2 SUM 1
---
For this assignment, you are tasked with designing and building a Minimum Viable
Product (MVP) for a GUI application within the Employee Management Systems(EMS) domain. It could be an event register, a diversity needs tracker, an employee performance tracker, or any other concept related to Employee Management Systems (EMS).

he Employee Management System you are to create and document may hold
employees' personal and employment details, possibly reflecting the organisational
structures of your workplace, such as its departments and divisions.
To successfully complete this assignment, you must submit the following three
items:
+ A PDF containing the Application Documentation (Task 1).

+ A compressed (zipped) folder encompassing your code
(comprising any number of necessary files) and data (one CSV
file) (Task 2).

+ A PDF incorporating a copy of your code intended for Turnitin
verifications.
The system you develop must have the following features:

+ A GUI to facilitate the input, viewing, and exporting of employee
data.

+ Capability to read from and write to a CSV file.

+ Implementation using object-oriented programming principles.

+ Comprehensive commentary, including appropriate docstrings.

+ Some exception handling and input validation.

+ Some testable logic, exemplified by pure functions for input
validation that, given the same parameters, consistently return
the same output.
You can enhance the system beyond the basic requirements outlined above. For example, you could integrate a feature allowing on-screen modifications of employee data and enable saving the updated information to a new file. However, to secure the highest grade, it is necessary first to meet the mandatory criteria(above).

# Task 1 Application Documentation

## 1.1 Introduction
Provide a concise overview of your workplace environment and explain the
relevance of your proposed MVP to your employer. (500words +/- 10%)

## 1.2 Design
+ A GUI design made in Figma or another prototyping. You must include screenshots and may provide a link to Figma as well. The design should be specific to your application.

+ A requirements document (functional and non-functional requirements)

+ The proposed tech stack outline (what technologies you will use)

+ A code design document, for instance, a class diagram

## 1.3 Testing Strategy

Write a coherent strategy for testing your application. Explain what types of testing you will use to test your MVP. Heads up, the second summative assignment requires you to write some unit tests using a Python testing framework. (500 words +/- 10%)

# Task 2 Application Build
Based on your design and the outlined requirements, construct the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a version of the product sufficient to be presented to the end user for the Workplace EMS, utilising any relevant Python libraries. Submit your code and data as a zipped folder and a PDF of your code only for plagiarism checks
